            <p>
                Climate is different from weather. When we talk about the Earth's climate, we are referring to the average weather
                conditions over a period of 30 years or longer. Weather, on the other hand, refers to what you see and feel outside from
                day to day (e.g. sunny, rainy). So climate change is any change in the climate, lasting for several decades or longer including changes in temperature, rainfall or wind patterns.

            <h3>
                The Effects Of Climate Change
            </h3>
            <p>
                The main threats of climate change, stemming from the rising temperature of Earth's atmosphere include rising sea
                levels, ecosystem collapse and more frequent and severe weather. Rising temperatures from human-caused greenhouse gas emissions affects planet-wide systems in various ways. For example, it warms the polar regions and the oceans, which melts ice cover at the poles and causes sea level rise. Climate change affects ocean habitats by lowering oxygen, decreasing phytoplankton (little plants that serve as the base of marine foodchains) and killing coral reefs.

            <h3>
                How To Stop Climate Change
            </h3>
            <p>
                In order to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says we must
                reduce carbon emissions to the point where we hold global warming to no more than an additional 1.5 Â°C. To do that, we
                must as a planet commit ourselves to reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050. This is no small feat and will require a range of solutions applied together to reach the goal. We'll need to transition all sectors of our economy away from fossil fuels that emit carbon, increase our use of clean energy sources like wind and solar, harness the power of nature to capture carbon, and deploy technologies that capture and store carbon. This transition will happen much faster and more cost-effectively if governments enact an economy-wide price on carbon.
